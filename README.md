# Nucleus
An inclusive application for promoting generativity in tech. Mentoring, growing and boosting your industry peers.

## Overview

The Nucleus project is about distributed generativity. That sounds fancy, but it's really just a portmanteau for an idea of raising everyone's technical and leadership skills in a crowd-sourced way. In other words, the Nucleus project aims to provide avenues for people looking for mentors, advice and feedback across a range of technical disciplines as well as enabling prospective mentors to broaden their experience and reach.
